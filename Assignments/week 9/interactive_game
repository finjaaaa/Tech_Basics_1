#jump'n run to the airport to not miss the flight
#suitcases & water spills as obstacles
#blocks of airport tiles as platform blocks for foundation as pixel art
#creating a class for the obstacles
#random speed but same moving direction & random spawn points
    #one for suitcases (move faster than water spills -> higher random speed)
    #one for water spills (lower random speed)

#player trying to get to gate (score system)
#creating a class for the player with fix speed
    #keys as left/right
    #space as jump

#basic platform as ground
#creating a class for the groundimage
#fix position, no speed

#eventloop
    #each missed obstacle adds points (3/5)
    #game finished at 50 points (arrived at gate on time)
    #fail after 3 collisions with obstacles
    #crating the counter for each collided obstacle
    #loop finished when points achieved, or if failed
